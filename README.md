# DDP-12D110009
Codes for the Dual Degree Project 2016-17 

## 14 June 2016

### Tasks completed till date
1. Neighbour atom coordinates upto 7th nearest neighbours
2. Data Extration code for neighbour atom coordinates
3. EAM data reading function and interpolation function, implemented using binary search.
4. Parameter extraction function
5. Lattice Generator for initial state of montecarlo
6. Lattice reading function
7. Metropolis decision maker

### Incomplete Tasks
1. **Unable to go from crystal coordinate system to lattice index. This makes us unable to compute energy.**
2. EAM energy computation block

## 15 June 2016

### Incomplete tasks completed
1. One to one mapping from array to lattice achieved with periodic boundary condition

### Incomplete Tasks
1. EAM energy computation block

These tasks represent minimum requirement for a Monte-Carlo simulation. After this is achieved, test runs can start.
