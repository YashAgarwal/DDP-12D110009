\subsection*{Neighbour sites files}

These files are named S1n.\+mat, S2n.\+mat etc. The number in the middle of filename indicates n\textquotesingle{}th nearest neighbour. Deleting these will cause code to break down.

\subsection*{E\+AM data files}

Names of all E\+AM data files is maintained in file {\itshape file\+\_\+list.\+txt}. Names of these files are like f\+Al.. F\+\_\+\+Ni.. p\+Al.. . Absolutely essential information

\subsection*{Parameters file}

Parameters file must have first entry an integer. This will maintain total no of useful values in the file. The next n lines must contain information. Except for the first rest all can be real numbers. Any additional data will be lost. If there as less values then the array created in the program will contain garbage values. If above convention isn\textquotesingle{}t followed to the letter can lead to segmentaion fault.

\subsubsection*{Current {\itshape parameters.\+txt}}

It contains following information
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item No of entries
\item Nx
\item Ny
\item Nz
\item Disordered phase percentage
\item Ordered phase percentage
\item Percentage of nickel in disordered phase.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{F\+CC crystal input data}

A little about how we store the fcc crystal

Every F\+CC lattice can be thought of a simple cubic lattice with a four atom motiff. Motiff atoms have following positions .

(0.\+0 0.\+0 0.\+0),(0.\+0 0.\+5 0.\+5),(0.\+5 0.\+0 0.\+5),(0.\+5 0.\+5 0.\+0)

We store the species information in a linear array such that atoms associated with each lattice points are stored sucessively the motiff atoms are needs to acessed uniquely so a coressponds to which atom we are taking about a=0 , 1 , 2 , 3 represent the 4 types of location that an atom can have

.this data is stored in {\itshape input\+\_\+data.\+txt}

output data format is same in the file

\subsection*{Random Initial Step}

By this we mean, {\itshape matrix\+\_\+generator.\+c} can generate a random lattice that will serve as an random initial step for the Montecarlo process. This function can run using the bash script {\itshape matrix\+\_\+compile\+\_\+and\+\_\+run\+\_\+once}

\subsection*{Running the code}

To run the code the code use 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 $ ./monte\_carlo\_script
\end{DoxyCode}
